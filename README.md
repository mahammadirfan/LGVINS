# LGVINS
LGVINS is a tightly fused multi sensor fusion algorithm which fuses two 3D Lidar's, GPS, IMU and stereo camera.

We have open sourced the Dataset obtained during LGVINS experiment for the community.
There are 3 datasets obtained in 3 different scenario. More detail can be found in the paper:

The LGVINS datasets can be accessed by : https://ulcampus-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mahammad_irfan_ul_ie/EfufUvtGiUNPounV15cRA6IBr7ykhd5cs_odo7SI2GrKAA?e=rc4CSK
